                How does the Campus Ambassador Program differ from an
                Internship?
              </h3>
            </div>
            <br />
            An internship is a kind of temporary employment where students have
            to perform specific tasks assigned to them. At the same time, they
            will be provided training on the skills you need to complete. Some
            internship pays the students while in some other you will gain real
            experience or academic credit. A typical internship lasts from weeks
            to months, and it can be part-time work, full-time during any time
            of the year.
            <br />
            Unlike internships, Campus Ambassador Programs are informal
            positions, where you do'nt work from any office but responsible for
            spreading the word about the organization they present. Here
            students are given minimum supervision, and students can find their
            ways to perform and have more control over what they work. Student
            Ambassador Programs use to get more networking opportunities from
            like-minded students and mentors. Anyway, both offer students some
            experience that can translate to skills on their resume.
