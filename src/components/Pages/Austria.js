            <h3>Quality of life</h3>
            <ul className="overpara0">
              <li>
                Austria is widely recognized as one of the most livable
                countries in the world. In 2018, the Institute for Management
                Development (IMD) awarded Austria the number one spot in terms
                of quality of life. The IMD uses a wide range of metrics to
                identify the world's most livable countries, including economic
                growth, innovation, and cultural heritage, as well as important
                indicators of individual well-being such as community spirit,
                mental health, and job satisfaction.
              </li>
              <li>
                Austrians scored high across all the metrics, but the highest
                levels of happiness came from people living in its capital.
                Vienna was recently named as the most liveable city in the world
                for the second year running by The Economist Intelligence Unit
                (EIU). Vienna scored top marks in economic stability,
                infrastructure, and education -- making this beautiful European
                capital the ideal place to start an academic career.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <h3>A rich intellectual history</h3>
            <p className="overpara0">
              Nobel Prize-winning physicist Erwin Schrodinger did much of his
              early research in Vienna and would go on to formulate
              revolutionary new theories in the fields of quantum theory,
              general relativity, and thermodynamics. Fellow Nobel laureate
              Friedrich Hayek studied economics at the University of Vienna
              before going on to positions at the London School of Economics and
              the hugely influential Chicago School of Economics. Hayek's
              seminal work The Road to Serfdom has now sold over two million
              copies and is still regarded as one of the best arguments for
              economic and political liberalism. In 2004, the novelist Elfriede
              Jelinek became the 15th graduate of the University of Vienna to be
              awarded a Nobel peace prize.

            <h3>World-class universities</h3>
            <p className="overpara0">
              Austria has some of the best universities in the world. In 2018,
              seven Austrian universities were included in the QS World
              University Rankings, with five institutions making it into the top
              500. The University of Vienna, Austria's oldest and most famous
              university, ranked the highest (154th.) With a student body of
              around 94,000, it's one of the largest universities in Europe and
              attracts undergraduate and postgraduate students from all over the
              world. Like many Austrian universities, the majority of courses
              are taught in German, although there are many English-only
              programs, especially at master's level.

            <h3>It welcomes applications from international students</h3>
            <ul className="overpara0">
              <li>
                Always research the specific entry requirements of whatever
                course you're interested in before applying. But, generally
                speaking, people looking to study abroad in Austria need a
                secondary school leaving certificate that qualifies for
                admission to university in your home country. You will also need
                evidence of German language proficiency. This can be a school
                certificate confirming at least four years of German lessons or
                a German-language diploma. If you decide to take a diploma
                independently, make sure you find a school or college that
                awards certificates recognized by your desired university.
              </li>
              <li>
                Students from inside the EU do not need a visa, although they
                must register with the local authorities three months after
                entering Austria. All other international students require a
                residence permit for stays above six months. You should start
                your visa application as early as possible and certainly no
                later than three months before the start of your course. Without
                a valid student visa, you will not be allowed to enroll.
              </li>

            <h3>Education System</h3>
            <p className="overpara0">
              Overall, Austria offers six types of higher education
              institutions: 22 public universities, including 6 Universities of
              the Arts, 3 Medical Universities and 3 Technical Universities, 16
              private universities, 21 universities of Applied Sciences
              (Fachho-chschulen) and 14 University Colleges of Teacher Education
              (Pädagogische-Hochschulen).

              <h3>Visa Requirements</h3>
              <p>
                Generally speaking, there are two types of Austria student
                visas; a short-term visa and a long-term visa. You should apply
                for the type of visa which suits the length of your study
                program:
              </p>
              <ul className="overpara0">
                <li>
                  Visa C (short-term). This is a short-term visa that allows you
                  to stay and study in Austria for up to three months.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Visa D (long-term). This is a long-term visa that is valid for
                  up to six months, and which you can then switch to a Student
                  Resident Permit. This is the type of visa you need if you will
                  pursue higher education or long-term studies in Austria.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <p>
                The Austrian authorities are likely to ask for the following
                documents when you’re applying for a visa or residence permit:
              </p>
              <ul className="overpara0">

                <li>
                  A completed and signed residence permit application form.
                </li>
                <li>An enrollment letter from your university.</li>
                <li>
                  Original photographs of your face against a white background.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Passport or travel documents that are valid for at least 3
                  months beyond your departure date.
                </li>
                <li>Proof of finances.</li>
                <li>Proof of health insurance.</li>
                <li>
                  Proof of travel insurance with at least €30,000 of cover.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A cover letter stating your reason for visiting Austria.

              </ul>
              <br />
              <h3>Other requirements</h3>
              <ul className="overpara0">
                <li>
                  A place to study has to be available at the University for the
                  Desired Course of studies.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The applicant must have an A-level or high school diploma,
                  that can be considered equivalent to an Austrian Matura
                  examination certification (either regulated by an agreement or
                  in individual cases decided by the vice chancellor, possibly
                  with certain requirements) or furnish proof of completion of a
                  three-year (minimum) study at another certified post-secondary
                  educational institution.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The certification must be sufficient for acceptance to the
                  desired course of study at a university in the country in
                  which it was acquired. Any study-related requirements (e.g.
                  entrance examination) must be fulfilled in the country in
                  which the A-level or high school diploma was issued.

                <li>
                  If the desired course of study in Austria is not offered in
                  the home country, then this proof is to be furnished regarding
                  the most similar course of study. Only if the country does not
                  have a university, this proof does not have to be submitted.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In addition, the applicant must have sufficient German

                  For international students, the fees are usually around
                  €726.72 per semester. This applies to nearly any degree
                  program.

                  Nevertheless, they are still usually cheaper than in other
                  countries. Depending on your university and course, you should
                  expect to pay anywhere from €3,000 to €25,000 a year.

                <h4>Living Expenses</h4>
                <p>
                  In the following listing you will find an estimate of the
                  monthly living costs for students (in euros). These figures
                  only serve as a guideline and cannot be seen as binding. Under
                  accommodation costs, a place in a student hall of residence
                  has been used as the basis of calculation.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>Accommodation</h4>
                <p>
                  The costs depend on the city in which you want to study, what
                  is included in the rent and the arrangements made by the
                  institution. Housing in Vienna, for example, is more expensive
                  than in smaller towns. You can find more information about
                  housing in our section on accommodation.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>Food</h4>
                <p>
                  Fortunately, Austria has many discount supermarkets, which
                  offer food at reasonable prices. Many universities have
                  so-called self-service student cafeterias (Mensa) where you
                  can get a good meal at a good price. But the cheapest way to
                  eat is to do your own cooking. Some average prices: a cup of
                  coffee/tea in a café: 3 euros, a sandwich at a bakery: 3,50
                  euros, and dinner in a typical student restaurant: 10 euros.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>Studies and personal requirements</h4>
                <p>
                  A metro or bus ticket cost around 2,20 euros for a single fare
                  in the city, a cinema ticket cost approximately 9 euros and a
                  ticket for a museum about 8 euros. However, students are
                  eligible for a number of price concessions. Public
                  transportation authorities and many museums, cinemas, theatres
                  and other cultural venues give student discounts when you show
                  your student card.

                  the public railway company and provides special rates for
                  taking a trip within Austria or to neighboring nations. A
                  SparSchiene Ticket is available for 9 euros by which you can
                  travel in and around Austria and if you want to discover

                The bike is a really economical way to travel around Austria. In
