                Most student reviews of studying in Belgium focus on the topic
                of city life and culture in the country, which is seen as very
                positive.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                Belgium is in the political centre of Europe and it is an
                exciting place for international students to study in Belgium
                because of the diverse native population of three official
                languages.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                Belgian cities provide many cultural attractions, as well as
                places of entertainment and a vibrant nightlife. Students find
                it easy to travel around the country or reach other important
                European cities.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                There are many opportunities for international students to
                secure a scholarship as they study abroad in Belgium, whether
                from the Belgian Government or another organization. If awarded
                a scholarship, you are able to get reduced tuition for your time
                studying abroad, making for a more affordable experience. You
                might even consider completing a college degree in Belgium if
                you deem it necessary.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                In terms of academic excellence, Belgium punches far above its
                weight for a small nation, several universities in Belgium
                defend top international rankings and combine cutting-edge
                science with world-class teaching.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                If you ever wanted to travel to cities like Paris, London, and
                Amsterdam, what if we told you that you can take a two-hour
                train ride from Belgium to any of these destinations? Because of
                the close proximity to other countries, it is possible to do so
                when you are studying abroad in this quaint country. Another
                side of the language coin is that it’s fairly easy to get around
                student life in Belgium even if you don’t speak one of the
                country’s official languages. Many people speak English,
                particularly in larger cities. What’s more, Belgian universities
                have many courses which they offer entirely in English. So
                whether you’re looking to learn a language or find a place where
                you can study in English, Belgium is a great option to consider.

            <p>
              In the Dutch-speaking region tuition fees for full-time degree
              programs are around 940 EUR per year for European students. For
              non-European nationals, the university fees in Belgium fluctuate
              from 940-6,000 EUR depending on the program. Study programs in
              medicine, dentistry or MBA cost significantly more.
              <br />
              <br />
              Students will also have to register for a credit or exam contract,
              where the credit contract costs around 245 EUR and the exam
              contract 111 EUR. For more detailed information about the exact
              study cost for the program of your choice, contact your Belgian
              university.

              In the Wallonian French-speaking region of Belgium, European
              students will have to pay a maximum annual tuition fee of 835 EUR.
              For international non-European students, the annual fees are set
              at 4,175 EUR. Again, the cost might rise in case you are enrolled
              in a medical or MBA degree. For more detailed information contact
              your university directly.

                  In Belgium you can either live in a student dormitory within a
                  university campus or rent a private accommodation. The cost of
                  living in Belgium is student-friendly and affordable, but it
                  all depends on the region you are living and your lifestyle.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the Flanders and Brussels region, student dormitory
                  accommodation is rather limited and most students live in
                  private student apartments. Living in a student dormitory
                  though will assist you in reducing your cost of living in
                  Belgium.

                  Your personal point of contact should always be your
                  institution, as they can guide you and give you additional
                  information about housing options as a student. Make sure to
                  contact them as soon as you get admitted. If you are able to
                  find a spot in a university student dormitory, then prices
                  start only from 200 EUR per month. If you are interested in
                  student private accommodation, it will cost you between
                  300-500 EUR per month.
