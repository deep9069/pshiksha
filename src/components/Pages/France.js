            <h3>Many options for international students</h3>
            <ul className="overpara0">
              <li>
                Of the 2.5 million students studying in France every year,
                around 12% come from abroad, giving campus life a distinctly
                international flavor. Thousands of courses are taught in
                English, although students studying courses taught in French
                will need to pass a language test such as the DELF.
              </li>
              <li>
                When it comes to finding the right course, international
                students are spoilt for choice. France has more than 3,500
                public and private learning institutes, including 72
                universities, 25 multi-institute campuses, 271 doctoral schools,
                and 220 business and management schools. What's more, it has a
                host of specialist universities, such as 22 schools of
                architecture and over 227 engineering schools.

            <h3>A great place for scientists</h3>
            <p className="overpara0">
              France is also an excellent destination for science graduates
              interested in careers in research and development. It has a long
              history of producing some of the most influential scientists of
              the 20th century, including the founder of bacteriology and
              microbiology, Louis Pasteur, and Marie Curie, the physicist and
              chemist who became the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize.
              Today, many of the country's leading minds are based at the
              National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), a public research
              organization with an annual budget of €3.3 billion. That supports
              more than 33,000 researchers dedicated to breaking new ground in
              biology, engineering, physics, sustainability, and the humanities.

            <h3>Education System</h3>
            <ul className="overpara0">
              <li>
                An American high school diploma sometimes qualifies the student
                to enter an institution of higher education in France. The
                institution will rate its equivalency on a case-by-case basis.
              </li>
              <li>
                An American associate degree often qualifies the student to
                enter during the first or second year at a French institution.
                The institution will rate its equivalency on a case-by-case
                basis.
              </li>
              <li>
                An American bachelor's degree may be rated as equivalent to a
                license. Certain institutions consider it equivalent to two or
                three years' study towards a DUT, BTS, or license. This may, in
                turn, qualify the student for application to a master's degree
                program in a French institution. The institution will rate its
                equivalency on a case-by-case basis.
              </li>
              <li>
                An American master’s degree qualifies the student to begin a
                second master's degree program in Europe or a doctoral degree
                program. The institution will rate its equivalency on a
                case-by-case basis.
              </li>
              <li>
                An American doctoral degree (PhD) is considered equivalent to a
                French doctorate. The degree qualifies the researcher to begin a
                postdoctoral program or to teach in French institutions of
                higher education.

              <h3>Visa Requirements</h3>
              <p>There are different types of student visas for France:</p>
              <ul className="overpara0">
                <li>
                  short-stay student visa: You can come to France and study for
                  up to three months on this visa, without the need for a
                  separate residence visa. This is suitable for those enrolling
                  on a language course or short-term programs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  temporary long-stay visa: This visa allows you to study in
                  France for between three and six months without the need for a
                  residence permit. It is non-renewable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  long-stay visa: If you want to study for longer than six
                  months, then you need to apply for this visa. This type of
                  study visa lasts for the duration of your course in France
                  i.e. three years for bachelors, two years for masters, and
                  four years for a Phd. Long-stay visas act as residence permits
                  and are called VLT-TS.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Submission of Visa application and collection of passports can
                  be done only by the applicant himself or through a travel
                  agent authorized by the Embassy of France, New Delhi. The
                  French Student Visa has two distinct stages of application.
                  One at the Campus France and the other at the embassy. The set
                  of documents can vary for both of them. You would be required
                  to submit originals at Campus France and Photo-copies at the
                  embassy/ consulate/ Visa Application Centres.
                </li>

                    Accommodation in France is cheaper than in other European
                    countries, but this will depend on which city you end up
                    living in. Students have several options when it comes to
                    living: student halls of residence, a shared apartment or a
                    homestay.

                  <li>
                    The average rental price of a studio apartment (for one or
                    two people) is €575 per month and €660 for a one-bedroom
                    apartment.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A homestay is €200-€800 depending on the location – which

                  <li>
                    French universities offer accommodation called cités-U
                    cheaply (some as little as €120 per month outside of Paris)
                    and they are managed by CROUS, the regional branch of CNOUS,
                    the national student service agency. The demand is very high
                    and is given out based on social criteria or for students on
                    an exchange or with a scholarship. There are also several
                    other private organisations that offer good value student
                    residences, such as Résidences Estudines, CLEF and ADELE.

                    part of their rent. You may not always be eligible for it

                  On an average of 200-250 EUR/month is required for basic
                  supplies in Paris. The normal cost for a dinner is in the
                  vicinity of 15-20 EUR. The bistros, brasseries and crepe
                  stands are the more reasonable choices for having dinner in

                  metro and tram which costs between 17 and 33 EUR. Taxis can
                  cost 1.25 EUR/km which is economical in Paris. One can lease a
                  bike through the Vélib bicycle rental programme. One can also
                  utilize the TGV for travelling in different cities and it
                  costs around 20-25 EUR per trip.
