          <h3>Bachelor Degree</h3>
          <p>
            Although you can study for free at public German universities as an
            undergraduate, there is a charge per semester for enrolment,
            confirmation and administration. This is typically no more than €250
            (Rs 24474) per semester, but varies depending on the university.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Masters Degree</h3>
          <p>
            Again, there is a small charge per semester for enrolment,
            confirmation and administration, plus a Semesterticket. Tuition fees
            for “non-consecutive” master’s degrees, for those who have gained
            their bachelor’s degree elsewhere in the world, vary between
            universities and may be around €20,000 (Rs1687904) per year at
            public institutions and up to €30,000 (~Rs2531857) at private German
            universities.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Application fees </h3>
          <p>
            There are also often fees for the application itself. If you apply
            via uni-assist, the certificate evaluation and the first preliminary
            examination of the documents cost 75 euros. Each additional
            application in one semester costs 15 euros, per university.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Costs of Living</h3>
          <p>
            While many students can study in Germany for free, living expenses
            are unavoidable. The cost of living in Germany is more expensive in
            some areas than others – Munich, for example, is considered the most
            expensive German city to live in, with living costs averaging about
            €12,000 (~Rs1012,742) per year. By comparison, the average annual
            living costs in Germany are around €10,200 (~860831).
            <br />
            <br />
            Rent will be your largest monthly expense, though this is cheaper if
            you live in a shared flat (average rent of €280/~Rs 23630 per month)
            or a student hall of residence (€234/~Rs19748 per month).
