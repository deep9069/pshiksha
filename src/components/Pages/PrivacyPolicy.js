            Premi ji&apos;s Shiksha 4.0 shares your personally-identifiable
            information only in limited circumstances where Premi ji&apos;s
            Shiksha 4.0 believes such sharing is reasonably necessary to offer
            the Service, legally required or, permitted by you.
            <br />
            <br />
            For example:
            <br />
            We may provide personally-identifiable information to service
            providers who help us bring you the Service, such as hosting the
            Service at a co-location facility or sending e-mail updates. In
            connection with these operations, our service providers may have
            access to personally-identifiable information for use for a limited
            time. Where we utilize service providers for the processing of any
            of personally-identifiable information, we implement reasonable
            contractual protections limiting the use of that
            personally-identifiable information to the provision of services of
            Premi ji&apos;s Shiksha 4.0.
            <br />
            <br />
            Notwithstanding anything else in this policy, we may work with
            partners who use &nbsp;mobile SDKs, including the OneSignal
            Messaging SDK, to passively collect information (collectively,
            &quot;SDK information&quot;), which generally helps us deliver
            personalized notifications. This data may also be used to identify
            you in a unique manner across other devices or browsers for the
            purposes of customizing ads or content. Depending on the permissions
            granted to this application, this information may include personally
            identifiable information (PII) including your e-mail address. This
            information may also include precise location (i.e. GPS-level data)
            or WiFi information, apps you have installed and enabled, and your
            mobile identifier (e.g., Android Advertising ID).

            <br />
            <b>A)</b> Opting-out of OneSignal Push Notifications - You may in
            most cases opt out of receiving push notifications by going to your

            &ldquo;Notifications,&rdquo; and then changing those settings for
            some or all of the apps on your device. (Different device
            configurations, or updates to devices, may affect or change how
            these settings work.)
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>B)</b> Opting Out of &ldquo;Cross-App&rdquo; Advertising on
            Mobile Devices - You can opt out of having your mobile advertising
            identifiers used for certain types of interest-based (also called
            &ldquo;cross-app&rdquo;) mobile behavioral advertising, by accessing
            the &ldquo;settings&rdquo; on your Apple or Android mobile device,
            as follows:By opening the Google Settings app on your device,
            selecting Ads, and then selecting the option to opt-out of
            interest-based ads. (Different device configurations, or updates to

            <br />
            <br />
            We may be required to disclose personally-identifiable information
            pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or
            in compliance with applicable laws. Additionally, we may share
            account or other personally-identifiable information &nbsp;when we
            believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests
            or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated
            through the Service or using the Premi ji&apos;s Shiksha 4.0 name,
            or to prevent imminent harm. This may include sharing
            personally-identifiable information with other companies, lawyers,
            agents or government agencies.
            <br />
            <br />
            If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Premi ji&apos;s
            Shiksha 4.0 business, or individual business units or assests owned
            by Premi ji&apos;s Shiksha 4.0 that are related to the Service, were
            to change, your personally-identifiable information may be
            transferred to the new owner. In any such transfer of information,
            your personally-identifiable information would remain subject to
            this section.
