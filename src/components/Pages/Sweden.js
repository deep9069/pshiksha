          <h3>High Quality, Unconventional Education</h3>
          <p>
            Studying in Sweden is different from studying in other countries
            because Swedish universities have an open climate with a strong
            focus on group work. The Swedish education system focuses more on
            your academic interests than pushing you to achieve a grade. Swedish
            universities work to prepare you for a successful future; the job
            market values ambitious, innovative, and perceptive team players, so
            Swedish universities attempt to instill these qualities in their
            students. Degree programs in Sweden offer students the opportunity
            to mix study and practical work, so that they have first-hand
            experience in their field when they graduate and enter the job
            market.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The education system in Sweden is student-centric. Relationships
            between students and teachers are relaxed and informal; as a student
            in Sweden, you will be expected to address your teachers by their
            first names. Swedish universities prize personal initiative and
            independent thinking; if you choose to study in Sweden, you will be
            expected and required to take an active role and contribute with
            your opinions and ideas in lectures, seminars, and group
            discussions. This will give you the opportunity to develop your
            individual strengths and cultivate you academic abilities.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Almost everyone in Sweden speaks English nowadays; 89 per cent of
            Swedes are bilingual, so international students from
            English-speaking countries need not worry about not being able to
            communicate if they don’t speak Swedish.

          <h3>Highly Innovative Country</h3>
          <p>
            Sweden is one of the world’s most modern countries, and the
            birthplace of many successful corporations. A number of successful
            inventions have resulted from research at Swedish universities and
            companies, including the computer mouse, Bluetooth, the pacemaker,
            the ball bearing, the dialysis machine, and internet applications
            such as Spotify and Skype. These recent inventions are built on a
            long history of excellence in academia and research in Sweden.
            Sweden is the home of the Nobel prize and several highly acclaimed
            universities dating back to the 15th century. This innate creativity
            has established Sweden as a strong nation within design, fashion,
            and music. It is one of the largest music-exporting countries in the
            world.
